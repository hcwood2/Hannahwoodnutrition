              If you’ve ever sat across from a doctor, trying to explain that something just doesn’t feel right —
              and left with a handout, a birth control script, or worse, absolutely nothing — you’re not
              alone. And you’re not imagining it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Women are consistently under‑cared for in the health system. Not just occasionally.
              Systemically.
            </p>

        </div>
        <p>We have a long history of telling women to be quieter about their symptoms. To tough it out. To keep pushing. To lose weight. To meditate. To “circle back if it gets worse.” Meanwhile, many of the conditions that impact women the most&nbsp;— PCOS, thyroid disease, menopause&nbsp;— are underfunded, under‑researched and wildly misunderstood.</p>
        <p>We call it “women’s health,” but rarely do we treat it with the urgency, nuance or respect it deserves. And that has consequences.</p>
        <p>The longer hormone imbalances go untreated, the more likely they are to impact digestion, metabolism, sleep, energy, mood and long‑term disease risk. You don’t just wake up with chronic pain or panic attacks overnight&nbsp;— these are symptoms that evolve when the early signs are brushed aside.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight-text">But you deserve better.</span> You deserve someone who listens without assuming. Someone who knows that your story matters more than a lab range. Someone who sees the whole picture, not just the piece you had time to explain in a 7‑minute visit.</p>
        <p><strong>That’s where I come in.</strong></p>
        <p>As a CNS&nbsp;-&nbsp;Candidate, I help women reclaim their health by identifying the root causes behind persistent symptoms&nbsp;— and building a plan that actually fits their body, their life and their goals. We don’t just slap on a supplement or remove a food group. We connect the dots between your hormones, gut, stress levels, lifestyle and symptoms.</p>
        <p>If you’ve been told you’re overreacting, I want you to know this: <span class="highlight-text">You’re not. You’re under‑supported.</span> And it’s time to change that.</p>
        <p>You don’t need to wait for your symptoms to get worse before they’re worth addressing. You don’t need to keep pushing through just to prove something. You don’t need to figure it out alone anymore.</p>
        <p><strong class="highlight-text">You’re allowed to want more.</strong> Let’s get you there&nbsp;— together.</p>
